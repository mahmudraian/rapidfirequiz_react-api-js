This is achieved by allowing developers to define routes that correspond to different URLs in the application.React Router can help developers create a more dynamic user experience by allowing them to handle navigation without requiring the page to reload. With React Router, developers can render different components based on the current URL, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.
